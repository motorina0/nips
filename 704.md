======

Key derivation for Encrypted Direct Messages
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:motorina0`

This NIP defines a way for two clients to derive `one-use-only` keys for sending and recieving `kind:4` events.

## Motivation
The content of `Direct Messages` (NIP-04)[https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md] is encrypted, but everyone can see who is chatting with whom. This is far from ideal from a privacy perspective.

## Suggestion
For the maximum of privacy the two participants of a `Direct Message` exchange SHOULD use a different public key for each `kind:4` event.
This means that each participant has to:
 - build a `direct message top key` from which it will derive keys to send `kind:4` events and keys where to recieve (listen for) `kind:4` events
 - share this `direct message top key` with its DM peer
