Republish Encrypted Direct Messages
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:motorina0`

This NIP defines a way for a client to indirectly publish `kind:4` events to a relay with the help of its peers.

## Motivation
One way to increase the privacy of Encrypted Direct Messages ([NIP-04](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md)) is for peers to derive new `one-use-only` keys when they communicate (see [NIP704](https://github.com/motorina0/nips/blob/dm-one-use-keys/704.md)).

This technique hides from the "general public" that two clients are chatting. However, the relay(s) in the middle can still see who is publishing events and who is listening for events with specific public keys.

## Suggestion
- `Alice` wants to chat with `Bob`. She builds the `kind:4` nostr event but does NOT sent it to the relay(s).
- instead `Alice` creates an event for `Carol` where the content is the event for `Bob`. `Alice` publishes this event to the relay(s).
- `Carol` receives the event, unwrapps it and publishes to the relay(s) the event for `Bob`.
- the relay(s) see the event as comming from `Carol` instead of `Alice`
