Republish Encrypted Direct Messages
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:motorina0`

This NIP defines a way for a client to indirectly publish `kind:4` events to a relay with the help of its peers.

## Motivation
One way to increase the privacy of Encrypted Direct Messages is for peers to derive new `one-use-only` keys when they communicate (see [NIP704](https://github.com/motorina0/nips/blob/dm-one-use-keys/704.md)). This technique hides from the "general public" that two clients are chatting. However, the relay(s) in the middle can still see who is publishing events and who is listening for events with specific public keys.

## Suggestion
